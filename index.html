            <h3>Resistor Piano</h3>
            <p>
                This one uses a resistor ladder to help the Arduino understand what key is being pressed. Code then outputs 
                a frequency for the piezo to play. I was inspire when I saw someone playing an electric piano. I thought to 
                myself, "I could build that" so I did. If only I could play the piano.

            <h3>Coolometer</h3>
            <p>
                Playing some tunes was fun but I wanted to learn how to print a message to a screen. Better yet let's try to 
                understand a speedometer. Here is my attempt at building that. Execpt instead of counting the rpm and converting 
                that to a speed I just use a potentiometer that controls a servo motor. Also I called it a coolometer because 
                naming things isn't my job.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I love microcontrollers. Imagine you can combine the feeling of satisfactory you get from writing clean code 
            that complies on the first go and beautiful circuitry. BAM! you have a microcontroller. I love learning as 
            much as I love creating. I saw an amazing oportunitiy for a fantasitc summer when I discovered the Arduino. 
            Bored of solving circuits in class, I decided to take it upon myself and purchase an Arduino in the summer 
            of 2023.
